The goal for this challenge was accessibility.

## Review 

1. I started off with writing HTML and CSS comments to organize it a little then I went to change some div tags to header, section, nav, and article tags.
  
2. I then added alt attributes to the <img> tags and added a discription to the images.

3. Then I create a few new class to make the css more simple and there would be less code, afterwards I deleted repeating lines of code and added the classes.
